### Notes
Challenges: I was having trouble installing the pod for the project. 
I then figured out that I didn't have CocoaPods installed which I installed using homebrew. 
I was also having issues implementing the bonus feature because for some reason it wasn't aligning correctly.
After a few trial and error, I got it to work.
